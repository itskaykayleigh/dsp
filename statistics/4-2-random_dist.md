[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*Exercise 2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?* 

import numpy as np 
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot


randoms = np.random.random(1000) 

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(randoms)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(randoms) 
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf) 
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'Random variate', ylabel = 'CDF')
